# Intelligent_Investor_StockScreener
A stock screener that is based on the the teachings and insights of Benjamin Graham and his book, The Intelligent Investor

Using tickers from Nasdaq, NYSE, and AMEX, stock data is scraped from Finviz. Stocks are then screened based on some principles
from Benjamin's Graham classic text, The Intelligent Investor

Stocks that pass the screening are then exported to an Excel file
